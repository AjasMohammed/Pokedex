# Pokedex WebApp

Hey there, Welcome to my latest web project - the Pokemon WebApp! üê¢üåü

## Overview

The Pokemon WebApp is a cool website that lets you explore the wonderful world of Pokemon! You can discover all sorts of details about different Pokemon creatures and have a great time!

## Features

- Check out the homepage with a super cool welcome message and a fantastic background image!
- See Pokemon details in awesome cards with moving pictures (GIFs)!
- You can click on a Pokemon card to learn even more about that Pokemon, like how it evolves and other related Pokemon.
- Use the search bar in the top to find your favorite Pokemon by name, ID, or type!
- The website looks amazing and works smoothly, thanks to cool technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The website is also powered by Django and Python, which are some really magical languages!
